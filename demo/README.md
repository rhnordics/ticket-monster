# TicketMonster - a JBoss example

TicketMonster is an online ticketing demo application that gets you started with JBoss technologies, and helps you learn and evaluate them.

Here are a few instructions for building and running it. You can learn more about the example from the [tutorial](http://www.jboss.org/ticket-monster).

## Running the TicketMonster Appication in Codenvy Cloud IDE
If you are looking at this README.md from within the Codenvy Workspace created from the URL below, then go directly to step 2.

1. Open a temporary workspace using the following link [Start](http://nightly.codenvy-stg.com/f?id=howu8pbv8hbaa079)
	
	Note that this is will create a temporary workspace and all the changes you do will be lost when you close the browser or your session times out. If you'd like a permanent workspace then you will have click XXXXX in the workspace and login or register as a user at Codenvy.

2. To run the TicketMonster application from within Codenvy Worspace click the Run icon or from the meny click **Run**.
